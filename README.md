# ManeBot API (manebot-core)

This is the home for the core API of ManeBot, an abstract plugin-based chatbot platform.

# How do I run this?

You probably want my reference implementation of the ManeBot API, which runs plugins and allows them all to talk to eachother in a nice, stable wrapper.  It's simply called ManeBot, since it's the flagship product of the ManeBot project.
