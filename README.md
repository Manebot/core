# ManeBot API (manebot-core)

This is the home for the core API of ManeBot, an abstract plugin-based chatbot platform.

# How do I make a plugin?

Check out my **manebot-test** project, which is a little plugin project you can fork or work from to make your own plugin.  Plugins can provide platforms (like, Discord or Skype), richly handle commands, depend other plugins to consume their provided functionality, and provide neat services and features to other plugins.

# How do I run this?

You probably want my reference implementation of the ManeBot API, which runs plugins and allows them all to talk to eachother in a nice, stable wrapper.  It's simply called ManeBot, since it's the flagship product of the ManeBot project.
